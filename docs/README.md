# Composer Package

The Composer package consists of:
* the [composer](../composer.js) Node.js module for authoring compositions,
* the [compose](../bin/compose.js) and [deploy](../bin/deploy.js) commands for
  managing compositions from the command line.

The documentation for the Composer package is organized as follows:
- [COMPOSITIONS.md](COMPOSITIONS.md) gives a brief introduction to compositions.
- [COMBINATORS.md](COMBINATORS.md) explains the composition constructs.
- [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md) describes the `compose` and `deploy` commands.
