# Composer Package

The Composer package consists of:
* the [composer](../composer.js) Node.js module for authoring, deploying, and invoking compositions,
* the [compose](../bin/compose) command for managing compositions from the command line.

The documentation for the Composer package is organized as follows:
- [COMPOSITIONS.md](COMPOSITIONS.md) gives a brief introduction to compositions.
- [COMPOSER.md](COMPOSER.md) documents the `composer` module.
- [COMPOSE.md](COMPOSE.md) documents the `compose` command.
- [COMBINATORS.md](COMBINATORS.md) documents the methods of the `composer` object.
- [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md) documents the JSON format for encoding compositions.
- The [tutorials](tutorials) folder includes various tutorials.
